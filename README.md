Usage Instructions
#### 4. Using the Program
Input Equation Coefficients:

Enter the coefficients of the equations through the console as prompted by the program.


The program outputs the solutions of the equations and systems of equations in a convenient text format.
Users can add new equations and obtain their solutions in real-time.
How the Program Works
The library uses standard mathematical algorithms to solve linear and quadratic equations and their systems. It prompts users to input the coefficients of the equations, validates the input, and then calculates the solutions. The results are displayed in a user-friendly format, and the program can handle multiple equations simultaneously, updating the solutions in real-time as new equations are added.
